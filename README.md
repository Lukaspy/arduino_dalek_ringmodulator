arduino_dalek_ringmodulator
===========================

Ring modulator sketch for Arduino Uno or Mega.

You will need the following hardware components:

- SparkFun Electec Mic
- Active speakers i.e. PC speakers with built in amplifier
- 2 x 10uF electrolytic capacitors
- 2 x 220 ohm resistor for LEDs
- 2 x LED for dome lights
- 1 x 330 ohm resistor for low pass filter

I will be checking in Eagle schematics *very* soon (July 2014).

arduino_dalek_ringmodulator
===========================

This git repo contains Arduino code for a simulated ring modulator which mixes audio input with a 30Hz sine wave to produce the familiar Dalek voice effect.

In addition to an Arduino Uno or Mega, you will need the following hardware components:

- SparkFun Electret Microphone Breakout (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9964)
- Active speakers i.e. PC speakers with built in amplifier
- 2 x 10uF electrolytic capacitors
- 2 x 220 ohm resistor for LEDs
- 2 x LED for dome lights
- 1 x 330 ohm resistor for low pass filter

I will be checking in Eagle schematics *very* soon (July 2014).

Please post any questions or comments to the following forum on the Project Dalek web site (requires a free account).

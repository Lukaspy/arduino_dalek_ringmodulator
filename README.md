Arduino Ring Modular a.k.a Dalek Voice Changer
==============================================

Arduino sketch for a digital ring modulator which mixes audio input with a sine wave to produce the familiar Dalek voice effect.

In addition to an Arduino Uno or Mega, you will need the following hardware components:

- SparkFun Electret Microphone Breakout (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9964)
- Active speakers i.e. PC speakers with built in amplifier
- 2 x 10uF electrolytic capacitors
- 2 x 220 ohm resistor for LEDs
- 2 x LED for dome lights
- 1 x 330 ohm resistor for low pass filter
- Optional 10K potentionmeter to adjust the sine wave frequency
